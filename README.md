# Repository of Alfred Lam
Nice to meet you, as a greenhand in programing and github, I'm pleasure to share some simple programs in this repository. Most of the programs in this repository are greatly simple because they're created during my learning process.
You're welcome to support any advice or point out any mistakes in programs. Most codes are simple and a great amount of them are about web crawler, I hope it can help someone just begins to learn python. Best wishes!
